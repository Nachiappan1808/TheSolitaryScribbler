          We humans come across many tough situations and scenarios. But with whom to share is the question? This is the first question. If yes, what all to share? is the second question.. If shared, will it be considered with concern or for sake.. This goes on and on, a never ending question pattern. And so over thinking adds more fuel to problems you have. Once such thoughts start to circle, it implies that you have put yourself in a complicated situation. This sows the seed for depression or I call it Retardation Of Positive Mental Behavior.

            This is the belief that binds people. When you get connected, you hold things between you together. What decides it? Only time decides whether it stays or breaks.Every soul feels down when promises are broken. Now, when are these broken? When one finds those better than you or when their priorities change, there is a drift. There is a shift from one bond to another. The value of relationship gets a crack with this.Now coming to the person who feels it. He / she starts to think things in a wrong sense when those people get involved. They will look better when taken apart and we will never want them to be closer any more. And so, never give a promise. If you really do, then never give up on them....

            An emotion that is not much cared about. But it is one outburst that gives you better hopes. What is it really? It is something that makes the dry soul wet, waters the seeds for a positive growth. Every feeling inside has to be thrown out to make yourself clear or else things can become worse. What does is it need.. This needs a heart to console. Hope consolence is far better than condolences. So what happens when you cry alone.. This takes time for you to get out of bad memories. Since there is not much change in state of mind, time swallows you up in some cases. Find a person who hears your cry and makes you understand, "Crying to come out is always better". Every tear drop you try to hold tears you down. It does not mean cry everytime anywhere. The place, person,situation matters a lot. Do remember this...

            This is a weapon that helps to know the power in you to grow better. When does this happen? When things go beyond your reach and you can do nothing at that point, its better to stay calm. Sometimes words can't express the emotions but silence can. When you talk, you hear others feelings but only when you hear others silence, you understand. Violent behavior yields you disaster but silence gives you inner peace. It is the calmness you need when there is chaos around you. You get deviated only when you hear the outer world but listening to this takes you higher. Do remember this, silence pays and some do play...

            The 'Special One' can never have a replacement. It really means. When there are many people around supporting you, your heart will always look for this one. Be it any topic or personal issue. What makes someone special? We will never know why but we feel better when we speak with that one and have a close connect with them. How to become someone's special? We will never know why but it just happens in due course. But this special one can't be there every time and that's the point where we start losing hope. So, be special to someone in a way you don't create bigger expectations and never forget them at any point...

            This is the last chapter of Mind Voice.
This is a good phrase to end every conversation. Irrespective of situation just try ending with it, more than you the person who receives it feels better. You might never know what situation others are in. You are in a position up and above the skies, feeling grateful of yourself. Expressing all these to every one else is fine. But after you finish your chapter of excellence ask others how they feel. Their response gives a clue of how they are. That's where your role begins. Hear them speak and know what is around them .The problem is no one listens. Even though you are in tough situations and there is no one around to show kindness, better change your mindset and start taking care of people around you, whom you really cared.. More than expecting someone to take care of you,  its good to care take your loved ones...

             There are mainly three causes for increase in negative movements in you.  You would have always had people around you at all times year round. But when you are too low there comes a situation where there is no one around. Here, what you had expected never happens.. The second is priority. You would have thought people who have been with you for so long would stand beside you in every situation. Sometimes people had to choose their priorities and people for their welfare and wants. This is primarily because of the final, most important cause that's selfishness. Each and everyone are selfish in each and every aspect. Its necessary to be happy for you but just try this out when you feel delightful for someone else, and you are a reason for that to happen, it just gives a different feel!!!

             Time to speak reality. What could be a solution to it.. In this fast moving world with never ending desires, do people really have time to ask about others. This is a big question mark.. Simple conversations aren't a matter of fact as topics are too shallow. Do you really think people would share darkest of all things all of a sudden if you ask.. Never.. It should gradually happen.There are exceptions here where the intensity of mental pain is too high. You can't insist or expect these. One hard hitting truth is, you can never be a therapist for others. You can share and give suggestions. Only experiences can give you solution. We cannot expect our favourites to be available all time and so be the therapist for yourself first. You try coming out every worst scenario you face. Sometimes it's hard to find people to give suggestions too. Once you are confident that you are able to manage yours, then lend your ears. Self - therapy the best medicine with no dependency but hard to exercise. Final one is, people live in status and social media rather than reality. Its always easy to give common statements in public and criticize opinions. Unless and until something happens to you nothing changes. Atleast, I hope things get better and before changing things around, people themselves be the change they wish to see...
