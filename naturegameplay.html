            The world has to accept that the word of 2020 is 'Quarantine'. The current stage is, we have started wondering about how we were once highly busy with our mechanised schedule to work. We would have expected a better growth and existence. Now nature has given a better response of reality. This is the best time to realize and re-build ourselves. Hope this has put an end to nature 's damage. A much needed end and nature demands a better start from here. Now, let's see how quarantine has made us in the upcoming beautiful chapters....

            The art of ' self care-taking' is something that has created a 'Room of Independency and Responsibility'. All these years we have been dependent on someone for each and everything irrespective of positions we have been in. Just think of this. Your room looks dirty. You ask the maid to clean your room and the work is done. But now, your role has changed. We can't be dependent on mothers as they are already piled up of huge stack of heavy duties. You take a broom, clean not just the room but the entire house. You are now put in a situation to think something more for you and your surroundings.. Now, more than self-care it has become a responsibility . Own your Roles and Earn your Rewards. Rewards here refers to the love you get back....

            Love for food is a never-ending desire for everyone. As the online delivery for essentials is open, the first thing we do is order our favourites and stack them up for a month or more. We have always liked the taste and smell of outside food. This always tempt us to order online. Let me tell you my experience. We decided to order food and finally added highly spicy taste to our taste buds served hot that night. The next morning hot news was 72 families and 20 delivery boys were quarantined as one among the delivery boys was tested positive of Covid - 19. One good lesson, more than our wants and desires, it's that one life we have. Everything happens for a reason. Better not to take risks during these times. Avoid outside food please...

            The room of creativity is the kitchen. We would try to do the best with a lot of references. Irrespective of the outcomes, our parents feel pleased with the trials we take. The souls that support every valiant effort we put. We add every ingredient, some new flavours and the final preparation always look heart-filling. The moment we taste it, the dish is truly extra delicious and gives us room for more innovation the next time. It's the attempt that matters more than the outputs we derive.Good chefs are not made in a single day and every mess you make, shapes you better...

            Locked down for a month, we are always waiting like birds in cages to fly sky high and enjoy the world outside. We are desperate for some celebrations. People who have their birthdays now have to celebrate it in their houses. Here is an incident to share. Curiously sitting till 12am, we celebrated a birthday with cake and pudding which was home made. Midnight galas are awesome especially during this time of the year. During school, they would have celebrated it in summer vacation and now in lockdown. They are used to it. Why wait for a release, when everything is possible at home in a way that's completely new when compared to other years....

            This period has given us a lot of time which has made us too lazy. We are fond of the warmth within ourselves, and love curling round, hugging pillows and dig ourselves fully under the bed covers.The time of waking up have gone past breakfast time. Many would have brunch or even lunch often. We have introduced something new to replace breakfast that's post-dinner. Sleeping at late nights has introduced this, which is around 1 am, mostly comprises of food from fridge or snacks in jars. Laziness can't be considered a con, as good rest gives you better health and makes you feel stress free the next day....

            Memories strike us with the hardest and toughest of occasions that remains unforgettable. Even on social media,you don't just ignore your old posts but roll back to those places.. The places you visit sometimes remind you about instances. Time,place and people are very much relatable. The games once played on board have come online and despite humans being separated, have got
themselves linked in their own ways. Social distancing has promoted video calls and chats, voice calls a lot. More than physical presence , it's just your mind essence of loved ones is all that's needed to share the seconds of memory roll of the past...

            All were running behind a purpose all these days. The purpose being Family. Many fail to identify, and forget this. Fortunately, nature has given us a chance to think and re-consider it. Our family has been our support system and keep work aside for a while, and try to invest few hours with them. All those smiles and giggles are truly worthier than anything in this world. Feel relaxed, take your time and bring back all those unnoticed minutes of your people...

            More focused towards work we never had time for sharing news or things with our friends. We might definitely miss the phone calls that we had once and re collect all topics spoken earlier. Now this situation has given us the time for best things to share with the best people with cute little topics. It's a kind of open heart talking we have always wanted and waited for. Just choose your time, people and the rest is fun and laughter that's guaranteed.You will know it's necessity in the next chapter...

            Inside every human resides a a beautiful soul. This seclusion has given us a Room for Isolation. More we are alone, the more we think. During day time, with others surrounded we never think about happenings and us. But this dusk is the dawn of thoughts and insights. You might be isolated physically but mentally not. We put ourselves in self analysis and analyse others too... Late-night chats and talks are always super special. Topics are diverse and the person is definitely not gonna get depressed or impressed as it's the truth and emotions that truly comes out.. Problems often turn into discussions that's where some arguments give us solutions.. That's the time when your heart conveys a lot and feelings can be exponentially felt. One thing, irrespective of how you are, you would always have some expectations and more than that it's the hope that keeps your spirits alive for a better you. People often think whether it's right time to speak but remember that we should never regret our decisions later. Utilize isolation, think, clarify and let the final choice be yours...

            Being awake in late nights, can be for anything. For example, if you are so keen to finish a season in a series or in the middle of interesting chapter while reading a novel, just go for it. Its your interest that makes you do so. Every thing you read must be a learning. Similarly, the time you have utilized for thinking must never go in vain.. You must start creating your interests and new hobbies. These are things that can give you true happiness.. Self interest becomes the driving force and it makes your atmosphere pleasant. We keep ourselves in a comfortable position with things we love around. We try to improvise ourselves, always take things that best fits us. Its not sure whether we would get same time and situations. It's not only the profession that we are going live with throughout, but it's also good to have some personal interests too. Every interest has its value and so create your values....

            I hope the chapters where a bit relatable. It's the chapters like these that help us know more. Take this span in a positive sense. Nature has taken it's duration to rejuvenate. We must use the same to invent and discover stuffs that make us incredible. There is always a calmness after all chaos and better survive obeying nature's orders as it is the 'Survival of the Fittest'. Fittest in the sense strong both physically and mentally. . We have costed a lot. The one who remains stable stays while others pay the price. You may call it politics but it's the nature that has got involved in between. Best way to end this, is that more than it's a conclusion it's a new beginning thats required. It's not about how civilized we get, but how we are gonna to maintain a balance in nature hereafter...
